* Problem 1: Miles per Hour to Kilometers per Seconds
** Problem
This year olympics were held in Europe causing all sorts of problems for the Americans as they don’t
use the standard measures like meters and kilometers, grams and kilograms. For racing events the
speeds are measured in kilometers per seconds. Can you design a solution to convert kilometers per
seconds to miles per hour for US viewers of the Paris Olympics?

* Problem 2: Even or Odds
** Problem
Mr. Bhola does not know what an even or odd number is. He is least bothered to learn the difference
either. It all comes down to your programming skills to design a program that will ask for a
positive number greater than 0 and prints whether the number is even or odd. Be careful, Mr. Bhola
can even enter 0 or negative numbers so your solution must give an error saying invalid input in
that case.

* Problem 3: Legal Age of Marriage in Pakistan
** Problem
Child marriages are a major problem in Pakistan. To avoid responsibility the Federal Government
delegated the task of Child Marriage Laws to provinces. Only Punjab and Sindh have updated the laws
while in Punjab the law is going under another amendment this year. To make things simple in Sindh,
No child, girl or boy, below the age of 18 can marry. Whereas in Punjab (until the new bill is
passed) and other provinces ACT of 1929 is followed which prohibits girls below the age of 16 to
marry whereas for boys the age is 18.  You are required to design a solution for both provinces to
make this decision easy by asking relevant information from the user and giving output whether it is
legal to marry to or not.

* Problem 4: Grocery Assistance/Calculator
** Problem
Imagine Mr. Bhoola is going to the market to buy some yummy fruits and vegetables. He's a little bit
forgetful, so he doesn't always have a list or a fixed amount of money to spend. We're going to help
Mr. Bhoola figure out how much he needs to pay and how much change he gets back. Here's what we need
to know:
+ How much money Mr. Bhoola has today to buy fruits and vegetables.
+ The prices of the onions, apricots, grapes, and tomatoes at the market.
+ What vegetables Mr. Bhoola buys and how many of each.
Here is an example of some random day in life of Mr. Bhoola
1. What fruits and vegetables does Mr. Bhoola buy today? (For example, 2kg onions, 1 kg of grapes,
   and 3kg tomatoes)
2. What are the prices of each vegetable today? (For example, onions cost $1 per kg, grapes cost $2
   per kg, and tomatoes cost $0.50 per kg)
3. How much money does Mr. Bhoola have with him ? (For example, $10)
Design a solution to help Mr. Bhoola every time he goes shopping!

* Problem 5: Crop Management
** Problem
A smart agricultural drone monitors a large farm to manage irrigation efficiently. The drone first
checks the type of crop being monitored whether it's wheat, corn, or rice. For wheat, if the soil
moisture is below 30%, and if it has not rained in the last 24 hours, the system will initiate
irrigation. For corn, if the soil moisture is below 40%, the system will irrigate regardless of
recent rainfall. For rice, if the soil moisture is below 25%, the system will irrigate unless it has
rained in the last 24 hours. If the soil moisture is above these thresholds, no irrigation is
applied. Design a solution to determine if irrigation should be initiated based on the crop type,
soil moisture level, and rainfall status.

* Problem 6: Amusement Park Ride Eligibility
** Problem
Safari park is a famous amusement park situated in Karachi that has specific height and age
requirements for its rides. For The Dragon Roller Coaster, visitors must be at least 48 inches tall
and 10 years old. The Sky Swing requires visitors to be at least 54 inches tall, with no age
restriction. The Carousel has no height requirement but visitors must be at least 5 years old. A
visitor is wearing a band so he may take as many rides as he wants until he is tired. Design a
solution that determines if a visitor meets the criteria to go on a chosen ride based on their
height, age, and selected ride.

* Problem 7: Which Floor...
** Problem
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 200px
[[file:which-floor-ref.png]]
There are 10 floors in a building 0 to 9. The building lift/elevator has a 1 digit, 7 segment LCD
Panel display to tell which floor the lift is on, as shown. The input into the LCD Panel is a
7-digit long number with only 1s and 0s. Each digit of the 7-digit long number tells which panel to
light or not to light from A to G respectively, where 1 means to light the panel and 0 means to keep
it off. E.g., 0110000 means only panel ‘B’ and ‘C’ are lit thus telling that this is the first
floor. Similarly, the number 1111110 tells that all panels are lit except panel ‘G’ displaying the
number 0. You need to design a program for a computer surveillance system to tell which floor the
lift is on. The input for the program is the 7-digit number comprising only 1s and 0s. The output
should be a single digit number 0 to 9 telling which floor the lift is on.  Hint: You can get the
last digit by using %10 and the remaining digits by using number division /10. Also, you only need
branching to do it.
