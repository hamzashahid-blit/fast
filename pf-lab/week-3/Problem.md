# Are we even?

## Problem

+ Create a Problem.md file which contains an item list in which an algorithm is defined for finding even
and odd numbers.

## Solution

1. Read a number from the user and call it `num`.
1. Check if the remainder of dividing `num` by two is zero. Note that the modulo operator (`%`) can also be used.
1. If the remainder is zero, print that the number entered, `num`, is even (as it is divisible by two).
1. If the remainder is NOT zero, print that the number entered, `num`, is odd.
1. Exit the program.
